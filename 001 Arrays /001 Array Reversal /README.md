### The code demonstrates how to reverse the elements of an array using a simple swapping technique.

#### Here's a breakdown of the code:
1. An array 'a' of integers is initialized with values {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
2. In the first 'for' loop, the code iterates from the beginning to the middle of the array. It swaps the elements at position 'i' with the corresponding element from the end of the array (position 5-1-i), effectively reversing the array.
3. After the reversal, the second 'for' loop iterates through the array and prints each element, now in reversed order.
4. The output of the code would be: 5 4 3 2 1

This technique efficiently reverses the array without needing any additional space, and it's a common operation when working with arrays in programming.
